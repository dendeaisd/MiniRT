## 📝 Description
"_The goal of this project is to generate images using the **Raytracing protocol**. Those computer-generated images each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system._"

In simpler words, from a 'weird' **.rt file**, full of numbers that follow [_specific guidelines_](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT?tab=readme-ov-file#scene-decription-file-rt-requirements), we generate **images**, that represent the "scene" that the .rt file "describes":

## 🎯 Mandatory requirements:
> as specified in the [Subject](https://github.com/rphlr/42-Subjects/blob/main/common-core/miniRT/en.subject.pdf)

✔️ Handling of the three geometric objects: **plane** 🃏, **sphere** 🏀 and **cylinder** 🧨. <br>
✔️ Management of all possible **intersections** of the objects.<br>
✔️ **Resizing** of the object's unique properties: diameter for a sphere, width and height for a cylinder.<br>
✔️ Implementation of **Ambient** and **Diffuse lightning**. (Ambient so that the objects are never in the dark.) <br>
✔️ **Hard shadows** and **soft brightness**.<br>
✔️ The program displays the image in a window, which can be closed by clicking either **ESC** or the red cross on the window's frame.<br>
✔️ The program must take as first argument a scene description file with the **.rt** extension:

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scene decription file (`scene.rt`):
- Each type of element in it can be separated by one or more line break(s).
- Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s), and/or tabs.
- Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
- Elements which are defined by a capital letter (A,C,L) can only be declared once in the scene.
- Each element first’s information is the **type identifier** (composed by one or two characters), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict order as follows:

![scene_map_explained](images/rt_file_explained.png)
💡 **TIP**: You can create **any scene** you want, by following the above requirements and specified ranges for the numbers.<br>

### ❗ Error Handling:
> You can browse many cases of [invalid scene files](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT/tree/main/scenes/invalid) and run them according to the [Usage](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT?tab=readme-ov-file#-usage) instructions, to check the Error messages we provide.
- Running the program with more than 3 arguments, or less than 2.
- Empty or unexisting .rt file
- Wrong extension of file, like `.txt`
- Wrong element identifier (only `A`, `C`, `L`, `sp`, `pl`, `cy` are accepted)
- Duplicate or absent ambient lightning, camera or light
- Wrong number of arguments for some element(s) (for example, 8 numbers provided for the camera, instead of 7).
- RGB color values not in the integer range [0-255]
- Ambient Lightning Ratio not in the range [0-1]
- 3d normalized vectors with x,y,z axis not in the range [-1,1]
- Camera's field of view not in the range of [0-180] degrees
- Light brightness ratio not in the range of [0-1] <br><br>

## ⭐ Additional (bonus) features we added:

### &nbsp;1️⃣ &nbsp;Cone Object 🍦
- The cone (with identifier `cn`) follows the pattern of the cylinder declaration, with only difference that the first x,y,z coordinates represent now the bottom of the cone:
![cone_description](images/cone_description.png)
- You can notice the presence of cone for example in the `icecream` and `dwarf` scenes above in the [Preview 👀](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT?tab=readme-ov-file#-preview).

### &nbsp;2️⃣ &nbsp;Colored Light 🎨💡
- We are parsing **RGB color values for the Light** (as shown above in the [scene decription file explanation](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT?tab=readme-ov-file#-scene-decription-file-rt-requirements)).
- Examples of rendered images with colored light:

![colored_light_images](images/colored_light_collage.png)

### &nbsp;3️⃣ &nbsp; Specular Reflection &nbsp; 🔦 
*"It's the reflection from a "mirror-like" surface, where parallel rays all bounce off at the same angle."* <br>

Our objects present specular reflection because they have **smooth surfaces** and thus don't have the imperfections that most objects in real life do, creating a clear and sharp reflection similar to that seen in mirrors. This effect enhances the realism and detail of the rendered objects, making them appear more lifelike.<br>

### &nbsp;4️⃣ &nbsp; Soft Shadows &nbsp; 🌔
Here's an example of the **soft shadows** we added, vs the **hard shadows** that were asked in the mandatory part of the subject:

![soft_shadows](images/soft_vs_hard_shadows.png)

### &nbsp;5️⃣ &nbsp; LIVE Movements of Camera, Light, Objects &nbsp; 🎥 

### &nbsp;6️⃣ &nbsp; Dual Mode of Running the Program &nbsp; 🔄


### &nbsp;7️⃣ &nbsp; Randomized stars in the backround &nbsp; 🌌
That was an aesthetic addition, because in the absence of planes as background, there was an absolute black background which we wanted to "beautify", so randomized stars were our "solution": <br><br>

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT.git 
```
2. Navigate to the project's directory:
```bash
cd MiniRT
```
3. Compile the program:
```bash
make
```

## 🕹 Usage

You can run the program in 2 different ways, depending on what mode you want (check above the [Dual mode of running the program 🔄](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT#6%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3--dual-mode-of-running-the-program--)). 


❗ For both modes, replace the `<scene_of_your_choice.rt>` below ⬇️ with the scene you choose from the [scenes](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT/tree/main/scenes) folder.
### &nbsp;1. For **HD mode**
You need to give as third argument the **`HD`** string and run it as follows:
```bash
./miniRT scenes/<scene_of_your_choice.rt> HD
```
which will open the "bigger" window mentioned in the [Dual mode](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT#6%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3--dual-mode-of-running-the-program--) above, with the **greater resolution** and **soft shadows**. 
<p> Examples: </p>

```bash
./miniRT scenes/snowman.rt HD
```
```bash
./miniRT scenes/grape.rt HD
```

### &nbsp;2. For **Interactive mode**
You run the scene without any third argument:
```bash
./miniRT scenes/<scene_of_your_choice.rt>
```
This opens the smaller window, with **hard shadows**, where you can move **LIVE** the camera, objects and light, to see the changes directly, as shown above in the [Dual mode](https://github.com/dendeaisd/MiniRT#6%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3--dual-mode-of-running-the-program--).
<p> Examples: </p>

```bash
./miniRT scenes/light_coloring/blue.rt
```
```bash
./miniRT scenes/icecream.rt
```

#### 📖 &nbsp;How to move the scene in the interactive mode:

When you run the program, the terminal will output this information:
```
AVAILABLE KEYS TO USE

You can combine moving the Element that you want:
- C for Camera,
- L for Light,
- O for all Objects at the same time,
- 1, 2, 3, etc for each object individually,

with either:
- Arrow Keys,'+','-' for translation in x, y, z axis
or
- ADWSEZ for rotation in x, y, z axis, respectively
```

which means that you can combine holding one **element key** with one **movement key** (for either translation or rotation):
![movements_memo](images/Movements_memo.png)
📌 *Note that, the number keys can only be used if the scene has **less than 10 objects**. Else, use the `O` key to move all objects at the same time.*

##### Examples:
- `C` + `+` :&nbsp;*moves* the camera in the z axis, giving the feeling of zooming in.
- `C` + `W` :&nbsp;*rotates* the camera in the y axis, giving the feeling of looking up.
- `L` + `▶️` :&nbsp;*moves* the light in the x axis, more on the right.
- `O` + `◀️` :&nbsp;*moves* **all objects** at the same time more on the left.
- `1` + `-` :&nbsp;*moves* the **object**, that is **first declared** in the `scene.rt`, in the z axis, bringing it closer to the camera.
- `3` + `D` :&nbsp;*rotates* the **3rd object** (third in the `scene.rt`), in the x axis, making it "lean on" the right.<br><br>

***Notes regarding the movements:*** <br>
▫️ *Light can only be moved, not rotated.* <br>
▫️ *Camera can not rotate in the z axis, nothing happens in that case.* <br>
▫️ *Spheres are symmetrical so can not be rotated.* <br>
▫️ *The planes are not moved when pressing `O` so that the difference from before is visible, since they consist the "background" to the other objects.* <br>
▫️ *The more the objects are, the more time it will take to see the movement if you use the `O` key.* <br>
